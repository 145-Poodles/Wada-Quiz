# Wada-Quiz
If you're a Wadanohara fan then you probably have a chance to like this game.
Its a Quiz, all you gotta do is answer questions correctly.
When you first start the web page you get the ready window, this thing below:

You click ready and the quiz begins, you get asked in a series of questions
20 total, because i'm not good enough to think of so many questions. I don't
think they are good too, i've never had the chance to make a quiz so if my questions
are easy or not making sense at all just try to endure it for me, k ty.
This is how the quiz looks like when you start:

You click on the question that is correct. Obviously if you haven't played the game
you won't get anything right unless you're good with guessing.

Have fun playing the game. All the credit of the content goes to Deep Sea-Prisoner for
the images i used and content from the game itself. <a href="http://wadanohara.wikia.com"></a> was used for
the information that helped make the quiz.
