# Wada-Quiz

***If you want to try the version where you get a game over screen after three
mistakes and you lose all your hearts, I recommend you clone the repository and
rebase to the last commit from Sep 28, 2015.***

If you're a Wadanohara fan then you're probably going to have a higher chance of liking this game.
It is a Quiz and you have to answer questions with multiple-choice options correctly.
When you first start the web page you get the ready window:

You click ready and the quiz begins, you get asked in a series of questions
20 total (10 in updated version). I don't think they are good, I've never had the chance
to make a quiz so if my questions are easy or not making sense at all just try to endure it for me.
This is how the quiz looks like when you're playing in either the version with the hearts or points:

You click on the choice that is correct. Obviously if you haven't played the game
you won't get anything right, unless you're good with guessing. With the new update
I have disabled the lost game screen with the hearts left so you can get as many
wrong answers as you want.

Have fun playing the game. All the credit of the content goes to Deep Sea-Prisoner for
the images I used and content from the game itself. <a href="http://wadanohara.wikia.com"></a> was used for
the information that helped make the quiz.
